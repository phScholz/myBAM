A useful tool to calculate total cross sections out of all physics input, e.g. number of target atoms, beam current, peak counts, half life, counting time... 

STANDARD STRUCTURE:
	- *.cpp files are in ./src
	- *.o files in ./obj
	- moc_* files in ./moc
	- ui_* files in ./ui

DEPENDENCIES:
The user will have to have the Qt-project framework of version greater than 4.6.2 and lower than 5.0. Also the mfile library should be available on the computer where the program should run. The standard paths should be /usr/include and /usr/lib. If this is not the case, the specific line should be edited within the myBAM.pro file.

INSTALL:
In Order to get the myBAM program running one has to use the qmake program of the Qt framework. "qmake myBAM.pro" should create a Makefile in the main directory. Afterwards one can simply run "make".
